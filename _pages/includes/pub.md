[Dual Advancement of Representation Learning and Clustering for Sparse and Noisy Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01781) \\
**Wenlin Li#**, Yucheng Xu#, Xiaoqing Zheng, Suoya Han, Jun Wang, Xiaobo Sun*

- DARLC is the first unified framework for joint representation learning and clustering of sparse and noisy images (SNIs).
- DARLC integrates contrastive learning, masked image modeling, and a graph attention-based augmentation to enhance representation learning.
- DARLC employs a Student‚Äôs t mixture model for robust SNI clustering, addressing class collision and improving adaptability.
- DARLC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 12 SNI datasets in clustering quality and downstream task performance.

A context-aware genomic representation learning framework for gene spatial expression imputation, pattern recognition, and function discovery \\
**Wenlin Li#**, Yucheng Xu, Mengqian Huang, Jin Chen, Hao Wu*, Xiaobo Sun*

- We develop a ‚Äúcontext-aware, self-supervised Spatially Informed Gene Emedding Learning (SIGEL)‚Äù framework, addressing the gap in methods for generating gene manifolds and utilizing spatial genomic context.
- SIGEL generates gene representations (SGRs) that are context-aware, semantically rich, and robust against technical artifacts across different samples, enhancing the biological relevance and functional understanding of genomic contexts.
- SGRs are applied to important biomedical research tasks such as imputing missing genes in FISH-based ST, detecting genes with specific spatial expression patterns, identifying disease-associated genes and gene-gene interactions, and improving spatial clustering.
- Extensive experiments with diverse ST datasets across various platforms, species, and tissues demonstrate the superior performance of SGRs in facilitating various analytical tasks, affirming their potential in data-driven genomic research.

Cross-sample Detection of Differential Expression Genes and Cells in Spatial Transcriptomics with STANDEE\\
**Wenlin Li#**, Yan Lu#, Maocheng Zhu, Hao Wu, Xiaobo Sun*

- STANDEE is the first model for DEG detection in ST samples across different conditions.
- STANDEE maps gene expression into a unified latent space, identifies common genes via Fisher‚Äôs test, and determines DEGs through ANOVA.
- STANDEE identifies DEGs and DEDs, quantifies developmental/recovery processes, detects vulnerable regions, and analyzes spot-level pathway enrichment.
- STANDEE has shown outstanding performance across various diseases, developmental and injury contexts, different sequencing technologies, and even cross-modal data.

Detecting biologically significant spatial gene expression patterns in spatial transcriptomics with SPIDER \\
**Wenlin Li**, Mengqian Huang#, Ye Qin#, Yucheng Xu, Hao Wu, Xiaobo Sun*


- SPIDER is the first framework to unify the detection of SCGs, SVGs, and SPGs in ST data.
- SPIDER leverages self-supervised learning to extract semantically enriched gene representations from spatial genomic contexts.
- SPIDER identifies biologically meaningful gene groups, ranks SVGs effectively, and detects disease-relevant expression patterns.
- SPIDER outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse species, tissues, diseases, and ST datasets.

[MEATRD: Multimodal Anomalous Tissue Region Detection Enhanced with Spatial Transcriptomics](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/33409) \\
Kaicheng Xu#, Qilong Wu#, Yan Lu, Yinan Zheng, **Wenlin Li**, Xingjie Tang, Jun Wang, Xiaobo Sun*

- MEATRD is the first method to integrate histology images and ST data for anomalous tissue region (ATR) detection across tissue regions.
- MEATRD leverages a masked graph dual-attention transformer to enable cross-modality information sharing and mitigate over-generalization.
- MEATRD combines reconstruction-based learning with one-class classification to detect ATRs with minimal visual differences from normal tissues.
- MEATRD outperforms state-of-the-art methods across eight ST datasets, demonstrating superior ATR detection performance.
